# Sound Gauntlet
A hardware/software project using a Bean+ and Arduino to build a glove for control of electronic music. The device integrates flex sensors 
and spacial positioning allowing the user to manipulate multiple audio parameters. Using a wireless bluetooth connection, the Bean+
microcontroller sends MIDI data to be interpreted by a Digital Audio Workstation (DAW). Any mappable parameter within the DAW can be
assigned to a sensor on the glove with immediate response. 

# Demos and Tests
A playlist of demonstrations of the device in action. This playlist is constantly updated.
